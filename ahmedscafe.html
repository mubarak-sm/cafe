<p> Welcome to Ahmeds cafè, you probably wonder why we call it a cafè, thats simply
    because we belive that this place emits the same energy. You come here to refresh, recharge and more imporantly 
    eat good! Thats why we call it a cafè wheter you come on a causal sunday, tuesday evening or friday night,
    you will always be welcomed!
</p>

<div> Even though we belive that pictures are important to visualize the experience, they unfortunately don't do justice 
    about the quality that you will exprience in real life. But to give it a try heres the following:
</div>
<br>

<div> How did we get famous, with the owners background and generosity Ahmed use to treat his guest right, 
    going above and beyond for anyone coming trough, inspired by his action he use to always drink tea so we 
    created our own tea with herbs variying every week that we give out for free, anybody can get 1 cup or 20, it 
    dosn't matter to us. Though it can be costly at times we belive that doing the right thing will always 
    give back in abundance, therefor the first on the menu is TEA!

    <h2 id="burgers">BURGERS</h2>
    <br>
<p> It's honestly really hard to make a good burger, it's so many things that can make a burger stand out, therefor
    what can we really do to diferentiate ourselves? We didn't know ourselves so we created the best with could - hence the names.
</p>
<ul> 
    <li> GREASY BURGER </li>
    <li> INSTA BURGER </li>
    <li> MAMA IT'S TOO HOT</li>
    <li> BASIC B**** BURGER</li>
</ul> 
</div>

<br>
<h2 id="fries">FRIES</h2>
<br>
<p> Making good fries is neither difficult nor impressiv and shouldn't be expensive, therefor any burger with additional 
    fries cost only 39,- HOWEVER, if you want fancy ones ask the following: 
</p>
<br>
<div> 
    <ul>
        <li> NORMAL FRIES 39,- </li>
        <li> DAMN FRIES 89,-  </li>
        <li> MAMA IT'S STILL HOT FRIES 89,- </li>
        <li> ILLEGAL FRIES 149,- </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2 id="shakes">SHAKES & DRINKS</h2>
<p> We LOVE our shakes and thats why they in our opinion the best ones everr. A might clash between superhuman 
    elements that found peace in our shakes - also basic sodas er 39,-  </p>
    <ul> 
        <li> OREO HEAVEN SHAKE </li>
        <li> CHOWDERS DREAM SHAKE </li>
        <li> GATHER SCRAPS! </li>
        <li> Long live the KING! </li>
    </ul>

    even in the pursuit of burgers! Bon Apetit!
